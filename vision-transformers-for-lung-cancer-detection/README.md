# Lung Cancer Detection ‚Äî Computer Vision Projects

This folder contains a series of deep learning experiments and models focused on **lung cancer detection** using CT scans and histopathological images. The primary models include **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, **CNNs**, and architectural variants. Each notebook explores different configurations, enhancements, or preprocessing strategies.
